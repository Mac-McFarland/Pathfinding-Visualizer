# Pathfinding Visualizer

Pathfinding Visualizer is a Java application that allows users to visualize and explore different pathfinding algorithms on a grid.

## Features

- Grid-based visualization of pathfinding algorithms.
- User interface for selecting algorithms, setting start and end points, and creating obstacles.
- Random map generation.
- Step count display for each algorithm.

## Dependencies

- JavaFX: A Java library used for building interactive applications.
- OpenJFX: An open-source JavaFX implementation.

## Getting Started

To run the Pathfinding Visualizer application, you'll need to have Java and JavaFX installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/Mac-McFarland/Pathfinding-Visualizer.git
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Ensure that the JavaFX dependencies are properly set up in your project configuration.
4. Build and run the application.

## Usage

- Upon launching the application, you'll see a grid representing the map.
- Select an algorithm from the drop-down menu to visualize.
- Set the start and end points by clicking on the corresponding cells.
- Use the "Add Wall" button to create obstacles on the grid.
- Use the "Erase" button to remove walls or reset cells.
- Click the "Reset" button to clear the grid.
- Click the "Random Map" button to generate a random map.
